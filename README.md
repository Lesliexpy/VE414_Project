# VE414_Project
### Objective: determine the number of Jiuling tress in the forbidden forest.
### Spell: records the position of the person at an 1-minute interval (accurate)
###               the number of Tayes close by (less 1 meter away) on the ground from the person (accurate)
###               the number of Tayes no far way (less 3 meters away) on the ground from the person (not accurate, unknown precise nature)
### Forbidden Forest: 107 * 107 
### Number of Jiuling: Unchanged. Can't move or be stolen.

### Task 1: To figure out what the spell has recorded. Make graphs of locations and useful information.
### Task 2(main task): Estimate the number and location of Jiuling in the Forbidden Forrest. 
###                   Make sure the assumptions are consistent with the data.
### Figure out what is needed to solve task2 if Jiuling can actually move.
